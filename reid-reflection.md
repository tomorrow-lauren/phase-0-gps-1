1. What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  * I was struggling with merging correctly, and making sure all my files were neat.
2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  * I think I really got the hang of merging. I also really felt like pairing went well. I learned a lot about how I like to pair from that.
3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  * I asked about changing directory on open of terminal. I asked about their experiences. I also asked the normal pre-pairing "How are yous" so we could be checked in.
4. What still confuses you about git?
  * I am not really confused on anything, but I'm worried that I don't have something right that I think I have right. I worry a lot.
5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  * I really liked it. John and Alex were very kind and understanding and we worked pretty well together. A++ would pair again!
